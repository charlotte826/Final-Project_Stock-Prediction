### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to predict the stock market using machine learning. We chose to focus our analysis on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.

### Outline
* This project attempts at creating an engine analyzing the market data to provide an estimate and movement direction for investor decision-making. The engine consists of a stock predictor (price) and economy predictor (sentiment). 
* Stock Predictor (Price): 
  * How can I maximize profit?
  * Algorithms: Linear regression 
  * Data: Historical closing price data from Yahoo Finance
* Economy Predictor (Sentiment): 
  * How the economy is doing?
  * Algorithms: Naive Bayes classifier
  * Data: Twitter feed content 
* Graphical User Interface: A stand-alone interactive website to show projections

### Data Sources
* Yahoo! Finance
* Twitter

### Visualizations

* Price
